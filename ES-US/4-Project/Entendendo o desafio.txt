MAIN GOAL
Create a banking system with operations: withdraw, deposit and view statements.

Challenge
We were hired by a large bank to develop their new system. This bank wants to modernize its operations and chose the Python language to do so. For the first version of the system we must implement only 3 operations
deposit, withdrawal and statement.

DEPOSIT OPERATIONS
It must be possible to deposit positive amounts into my bank account. v1 of the project only works with 1 user, so we don't need to worry about identifying the branch and bank account number. All deposits must be stored in a variable and displayed in the statement operation.

WITHDRAWAL OPERATIONS
The System must allow you to make 3 daily withdrawals with a maximum limit of R$500.00 per withdrawal. If the user does not have a balance in their account, the system must display a message stating that it will not be possible to withdraw the money due to lack of balance. All withdrawals must be stored in a variable and displayed in the statement operation.

STATEMENT OPERATIONS
This operation must list all deposits and withdrawals made to the account. At the end of the list, the current account balance should be displayed.
Values ​​must be displayed using the format R$ xxx.xx, example
1500.45 = R$ 1500.45.
