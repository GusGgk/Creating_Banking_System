General Objective - What are arithmetic operators and how to use them
Routes - 
Step 01 - Knowing the arithmetic operators
Step 02 - Operator Precedence

STAGE 01
What are?
Arithmetic operators perform mathematical operations such as addition subtraction with operands.

 ADDITION, SUBTRACTION AND MULTIPLICATION

#ADDITION
print(1+2)
3

#SUBTRACTION
print(10-2)
8

#MULTIPLICATION
print(4*3)
12

DIVISION AND WHOLE DIVISION

#DIVISION
print(12 / 3)
4.0

#ENTIRE DIVISION
print(12 // 2)
6

MODULE AND EXPONENTIATION

#MODULE (remainder of division)
print(10 % 3)
1

#EXPONENTIATION
print(2 ** 3)
8

STAGE 02 - PRECEDENCE OF OPERATORS

IN MATHEMATICS
There is a rule that indicates which operations must be performed first. This is useful because when analyzing an expression, depending on the order of operations, the value may be different:

x = 10 - 5 * 2
Is x equal to 10 or 0?

PYTHON follows the logic of mathematics
The definition indicates the following correct order:
-PARENTHESES
-EXPONENTS
-MULTIPLICATIONS AND DIVISIONS (from left to right)
- ADD AND SUBTRACTIONS (from left to right)

EXAMPLES
print(10 - 5 * 2)
0

print((10 - 5) * 2)
10

print(10 ** 2 * 2)
200

print(10 ** (2 * 2))
10000

print(10 / 2 *4)
20.0
