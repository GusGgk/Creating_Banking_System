GENERAL OBJ - understand Logical operators and how they work

Route
STAGE 1 - GETTING TO KNOW THE OPERATORS 

What are?
They are operators used in a set with comparison operators, to assemble a logical expression.
When a comparison operator is used, the result returned is a Boolean, so we can combine comparison operators with logical operators.
Example:
op_comparacao + op_logico + op_comparacao...N...

Example
balance = 1000
withdrawal = 200
limit = 100

balance >= withdrawal
true

withdrawal <= limit
false


AND OPERATOR
balance = 1000
withdrawal = 200
limit = 100

balance >= withdrawal and withdrawal <= limit
false
(both have to be true to be true, if there is one wrong it is automatically false)


OR OPERATOR (OR)
balance = 1000
withdrawal = 200
limit = 100

balance >= withdrawal or withdrawal <= limit
true
(If among the options there is one true, then it is true, if they are all false then false)


NEGATION OPERATOR (NOT)
(think it's the opposite of the truth)
emergency_contracts = []

not 1000 > 1500
true

not emergency_contracts
true

not "withdrawal 1500;"
false

not ""
true

PARENTHESES
balance = 1000
withdrawal = 250
limit = 200
special_account = true

balance >= withdrawal and withdrawal<= limit or special_conta and balance >= withdrawal
true

(balance >= withdrawal and withdrawal <=limit) or (special_account and balance >= withdrawal)
true

(use parentheses to make reading easier)
