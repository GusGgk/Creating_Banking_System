STAGE 02
INTERPOLATION OF VARIABLES

INTRODUCTION
In Python we have 3 ways to interpolate variables in strings, the first is to use the % sign
the second is using the format method
and the last one is using f strings.

The first way is currently not recommended and its use in Python 3 is rare, for this reason we will focus on the last two.

OLD STYLE %
name="Guilherme"
age = 28
profession = "Programmer"
language = "Python"

print("Hello, my name is %s. I am %d years old, I work with %s and I am enrolled in the %s course." % (name, age, profession, language))

Hi, my name is Guilherme, I'm 28 years old, I work as a programmer and I'm enrolled in the Python course.
(don't use this %)

FORMAT METHOD {}
name="Guilherme"
age = 28
profession = "Programmer"
language = "Python"

(this first option is the least important)
print("Hello, my name is {}. I'm {} years old, I work with {} and I'm enrolled in the {} course." .format (name, age, profession, language))

print("Hello, my name is {3}. I'm {2} years old, I work with {1} and I'm enrolled in the {0} course." .format (language, ptofissao, age, name))



print("Hello, my name is {name}. I'm {age} years old, I work with {profession} and I'm enrolled in the {language} course.".format(name=name, age=age, profession=profession , language=language))

print("Hello, my name is {name}. I'm {age} years old, I work with {profession} and I'm enrolled in the {language} course.".format(**person))

Hello, my name is Guilherme, I'm 28 years old, I work as a programmer and I'm enrolled in the Python course.


F STRINGS METHOD
(the more visibly better)
name="Guilherme"
age = 28
profession = "Programmer"
language = "Python"

print(f"Hello, my name is {name}. I'm {age} years old, I work as {profession} and I'm studying {language}.")

Hi, my name is Guilherme, I'm 28 years old, I work as a programmer and I'm enrolled in the Python course.



FORMAT STRINGS WITH F-STRINGS
PI = 3.14159

print(f"PI value: {PI:.2f}")
"PI Value: 3.14"

print(f"PI value: {PI:10.2f}")
"PI Value: 3.14"
